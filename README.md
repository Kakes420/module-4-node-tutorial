# Node.js + Express Tutorial

This project was built while following the Module 4 Tutorial - Intro to Backend Development assignment for SDEV255.

It uses Node.js and Express to create a basic backend that serves a homepage, an about page, handles redirects, and shows a custom 404 error page.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Node.js is installed.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `nodemon app.js` or `node app.js` to start the server.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Pages

- `/` - Homepage
- `/about` - About Page
- `/about-us` - Redirects to `/about`
- Any other route shows the 404 page
